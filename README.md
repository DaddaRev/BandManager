# BandManager
Band service for managing setlist, songs and events with an easy GUI for the final user.<br><br>
The program allows information to be maintained on multiple different band profiles, each 
with its own set of repertoire songs and scheduled events. The user can log on to the system 
in guest mode to access and view the data of the band of interest, or, using appropriate login 
credentials, can log on to the system as a band profile and edit the songs and events in the 
database.<br>
